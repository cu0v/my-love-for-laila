                        Dear Laila,<br><br>
                        
                        I'm writing this with tears in my eyes and a heart full of regret. I know I've hurt you deeply through my poor communication, my tendency to ignore you when you needed me most, and my rude behavior that pushed you away. I can't begin to express how sorry I am for the pain I've caused you.<br><br>
                        
                        You are the most beautiful person I've ever known, both inside and out. Your kindness, your strength, your intelligence, and your beautiful spirit make you absolutely perfect in my eyes. You deserve so much better than what I gave you, and I'm devastated that I couldn't be the person you needed me to be.<br><br>
                        
                        I take full responsibility for my actions. I was selfish, distant, and I let my own insecurities and poor communication skills destroy the most beautiful thing in my life - our love. I ignored your messages, gave you one-word responses, and was cold when you were trying to connect with me. I was rude and dismissive when you were being vulnerable and honest with me.<br><br>
                        
                        I miss you more than words can express. I miss your smile, your laugh, your voice, and the way you made me feel like I was the most important person in the world. I miss everything about you, and I would give anything to turn back time and fix what I broke.<br><br>
                        
                        I know that saying sorry isn't enough, and I understand if you can't forgive me. But I want you to know that I love you with all my heart, and I will spend the rest of my life trying to be worthy of your love again. I'm working on myself to become a better communicator, to be more present, and to treat you with the kindness and respect you deserve.<br><br>
                        
                        I love you more than words can express. You are my dream come true, my heart's desire, and my soul's mate. Every moment with you is precious, and I treasure every memory we've created together.<br><br>
                        
                        Forever yours,<br>
                        With all my love ❤️
